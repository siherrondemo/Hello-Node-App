We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works. Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/).

##### Build instructions #####
1. Install the LaunchDarkly Node.js SDK by running `npm install`
2. Copy your Server SDK key and feature flag key from your LaunchDarkly dashboard into `index.ts`
3. Run `npm start`
4. A response will then be logged out according to the flag state.
